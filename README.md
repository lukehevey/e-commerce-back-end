  ## Description
  The purpose of this project was to help an internet retail company have a working back-end with the latest technologies for their e-commerce website. This project only consists of JavaScript. There were challenges with this project. Back-end still feels like a fresh concept with a whole new way of doing things. There will be improvements done to this project as I improve my skills.
